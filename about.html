            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                I'm second year applied physics bachelor student in Aalto University. I choose this major as I'm still looking for a distinct discipline to specialize in. 
                I've a minor in bioinformatics and courses both planned and taken in mechatronics and electronics and also at the moment it feels that my interest are moving
                towards those topics more and more. I've got some background addtitionally in 3D arts (also this background image seen on my website is my own production).
            </p>
            
            <h1>My aim for this course</h1>
            <p>
                I took this course as I'm interested in learning to build stuff myself. Also, as I have both technical and some artistic background 
                and as this course provides large variety of different subjects, I think this course will be great for me. I aim to complete a mini project on this course
                but I have yet to decide what it will be. 
                <br><br>
                Now in the first week I already got really excited on HTML and website development neither of which I had tried before 
                but both turned out to be really cool and surprisingly also really simple (at least on basics-level). I have started to think about creating my own proper websites
                to work as a sort of portfolio. Something a bit more flashy and dynamic than this documentation website for this course.
