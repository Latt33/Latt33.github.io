            <h1>General Use of Different Media File Types Used on Web</h1>
            <p>
                Media files are nowadays used on almost every website.
                Media files provide an easy way to express concepts and ideas in a compact manner.
                For example, images and videos can be used to visualize different things.
                Source code and project files on the other hand can be used to provide details to those interested.
                There exists many different types of files for each type of media and data. To give a few examples, images can be stored as
                jpg, png or webp, videos in mp4, WebM or AVI and source code in HTML or CSS format. A format means a way to store the data in a file.
                <br><br>
                However, media files can be heavy for the site as they can take up large amount of memory. That's why it is generally
                a good idea to think about media optimization. Media optimization means that
                media used on web is also optimized for web. This generally means making the files less memory intensive.
                The less memory a file takes, the faster the page loads which is naturally good for web users.
            </p>

            <h1>Image Management for Web</h1>
            <p>
                As discussed above, images are a common target for optimization.
                Image files can be managed multiple ways. First possibility to reduce size of the image file
                is to crop the image. Cropping means the removal of, often irrelevant, areas of the image.
                Another option is to resize image which means adding or remowing digital material, that is either pixels or vector data.
                Third most common option is to compress the image. Compressing is algorithm-based data stroring. In a way, image compression
                packs the image to take up less size.
                <br><br>
                An example of compressed image is shown in the picture below. The modifications to this picture are done 
                using ImageMagick software and command-line. The original size of the image was 2880x1620 px. The image was first 
                resized to 1920 px in width. Then I converted image to jpg format and stripped the metadata. After that 
                the image checked the requirements of 1920 px width and less tha 550 kB in size (now 116 kB). Command-line commands
                used are the following.
                    <pre>
                <code>
                    magick input.png -resize 1920 resized.png
                    magick resized.png -quality 85 compressed.jpg
                    magick input.jpg -strip output.jpg
                </code>
                    </pre>
            </p>

            <h1>Video Management for Web</h1>
            <p>
                Video files can be more challenging to optimize. For example, it took me abou 10 minutes to reduce the size of the image
                file gy half with no experience. In contrast it took 30 minutes to halve the size of the video file. 
                Video file management involves a lot of same kinds of consepts as image file management. For example video resizing and compression 
                both work very much the same way as in image management. In addition to these, videos can be also cutted and captured to be a better fit for the web.
                Cutting the video means simply extracting the unnessessary parts. Correct video capture in the first place allows one to modify the video less or more easily.
                Also when capturing the video, one also determines the format, which also plays a crucial role when it comes to file size.
                <br><br>
                An example of compressed video is shown embedded below. The modifications to this video are done 
                using ffmpeg software and command-line. The original size of the video was over 70 MB.
                Command used in modifications is the following:
                    <pre>
                <code>
                    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -t 10 -vf "scale=1280:720,format=yuv420p" 
                    -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 40 -b:v 10k -an 
                    -movflags +faststart output.mp4
                </code>
                    </pre>
                The result is a very low quality video, but it is less than 1 MB! All the crucial information is still well visible in video.
            </p>
            
            <video width="640px" height="360px" controls style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">
                <source src="../media/modified_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.

            <h1>Copyright, Licensing and AI</h1>
            <p>
                Addressing copyright, licensing and AI matters is important when creating a documentation website.
                Copyright allows one to protect their own original work from being copied and used by others. 
                Licensing on the other hand expresses how other people can use content on your documentation page. 
                One can for example express that all the things on documentation site is open-source or then entirely restricted from outer use.
                Last but nowadays not least, AI matters should be taken into account. One can for example use ai.txt files to tell web crawlers that collect data for AI 
                development how to use data on this site. However it is also adviced to tell if and how you have used AI to create 
                content visible on you documentation website. 
                By clearly addressing copyright, licensing and AI considerations, one can first of all 
                protect their own work but also others.
                <br><br>
                My choise of license for the documentation page is visible in the footer and is based on Creative Commons License Chooser.
                I chose this license because it protects and serves the purpose of this website the best. For AI data mining, I have created a ai.txt file using
                <a href =https://site.spawning.ai/spawning-ai-txt#ai-text-generator>Spawning</a> which is a website for creating ai.txt files.
