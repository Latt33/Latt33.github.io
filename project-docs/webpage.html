            <h1>Planning</h1>
            <p>
                Plan for building the documentation website was simple. Use simple hierarcical structure starting from index file and branching from that.
                Add navigation menus for each page. Use project management page as a sort of linktree to the more in-detail desciptions of different projects.
                I also wanted to add some character to the website as well as make it look good both on computer and on mobile.
                <br><br>
                I chose to use Visual Studio Code for creating and editing my HTML files and Github to publish my websites as there is a plug-in in Virtual Studio Code
                that allows one to add files to Github directly and that will potentially speed up my work.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Workflow</h1>
            <p>
                Workflow used in this project was simple. Frist, complete the idea to the point that I have no knowledge on how to proceed. Then look up on either 
                <a href =https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML>MDN Web Docs</a> how to do it or then ask some GPT on it's opinion, how would it do the required things.
                If the GPT example is good, I would use it as it is or then modify it to fit into my case more precisely.
                <br><br>
                To do more advanced things on css, I tended to make a small and simple test first and then after that apply the knowledge and already complete framwork to larger
                entities. A small example is provided below where I have first tried to create my own class "center" and then after learning how to use classes I have used things
                knowledge on making the classes adapt to window sizes using media query.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Examples of created classes in css file.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h1>Polishing and Finishing</h1>
            <p>
                For the final touches I added the background image and adjusted the colors on each page. I also made sure that the pages adapt correctly to changes in window size.
                After everything is checked to be okay I used the Github to publish my files as a website. 
                <br><br>
                I created a repository in Github following the instructions for the Github Pages which is a feature allowing to host websites straight from Github repository. Ultimately I was not able to
                load all the files straight from VS Code as I had some problems with branches. I had to manually upload some folders to repository using the Github website UI. After that the website works 
                flawlessly and is accessible via <a href =https://latt33.github.io/digital-fabrication-I/>this link</a>.
