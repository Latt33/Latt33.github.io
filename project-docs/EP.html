            <h1>What is a Microcontroller (MCU)</h1>
            <p>
                An embedded system is a specialized computing system that is designed to perform some spesific task. 
                Microcontroller (MCU) is a small computer device designed and programmed to control this system. 
                MCU consists of a prosessor (CPU), memory device (RAM,Flash) and/or input/output ports all in a single chip.
                MCUs are designed into embedded systems so that they require minimal user intervention.
                <br><br>
                MCUs are used in countless applications. Basically every device that performs actions that are not directly controlled by the user 
                include some sort of MCU. And even if it seems that the user directly controls the device, there might still be a microcontroller to 
                control the device on a lesser scale like for example in an electric shaver. Few examples of microcontroller applications are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Home automation (smart lights, thermostats, speakers, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Robotics (drones, robot vacuum cleaners, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Phones and watches</li>
                    <li>Automotive and Industrial (cars, factory robotics, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                In addition, MCUs provide a flexible layout for own projects. Ideally, MCUs could be used in any device, but in reality they are not the solution to 
                every problem due to their limited performance or then their size.
            </p>

            <h1>Basic Electronic Concepts</h1>
            <p>
                Characteristics of an electric circuit can be represented by its simplest in three quantities; 
                voltage, current and resistance. Voltage describes the electric potential difference between two points and it drives the current trough the circuit. 
                Current describes the flow of electrons in the circuit. Resistance tell how much object resists the current. 
                <br><br>
                Voltage U, current I and resistance R are related via Ohms law U=RI. So for example, if we know how large of a voltage drop we want over some component in our circuit 
                and we know the current in the circuit, we can determine the required resistance of that component. Ohms law is an idealization of these relations but it works as a simple 
                and easy guide on how these basic characteristics relate and effect each other.
            </p>

            <h1>Soldering and Safety</h1>
            <p>
                When working with electronics, it is crucial to remember safety in order to save the component as well as yourself from damage. 
                In soldering process it is most important to remember the following aspects. First, the soldering iron is hot and should be treated carefully. 
                This is why the soldering iron, when turned on, should be monitored and stored in its own handle when not in use.
                Secondly, because it is hot, it produces gases that are not nice to breathe in. This is why it is important to remember turning on fume exhaust and solder near it. 
                Additionally, the working area should be clean of everything that is not used in the process.
                <br><br>
                After the soldering is done, it is a good practice to check for possible short circuits using a multimeter. And of course, even common sense 
                tells that it is not a good idea to work on electronics when they are powered on.
                <br><br>
                Below are pictures of the soldered headers as well as a picture of the soldering process where you can also see the fume exhaust. 
                The soldering process succeeded quite well with very little experience but in the pictures one can see that the connections turned out to be 
                quite bulky so there is certainly still improvements to be done.

            <h1>Arduino Code Elements</h1>
            <p>
                Arduino sketch is a program for designing programs for Arduino MCUs. Arduino sketch code is based on C/C++ programming languages.
                It can be written on <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino IDE</a>. The skecth includes some basic coding elements like
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>#define</code> is a command for creating macros. 
                        Macros are essentially symbolic names for values that are replaced in the preprocessor at
                        compile-time without taking up memory.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>setup()</code> is a function that runs once when the Arduino MCU is powered on. 
                        It can be used to initialize variables, pin setting, etc.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>loop()</code> is a function that runs continously (loops) after <code>setup()</code>. 
                        It is used for the actual functionalities of the MCU like checking inputs and updating outputs.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>pinMode()</code> is used in <code>setup()</code> to configure pins as either INPUT, OUTPUT or INPUT_PULLUP.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>digitalWrite()</code> is used to control the voltage state of an output pin (either HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V)).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Additionally there is also the possibility to use different variable types, like INT, CHAR, FLOAT and BOOLEAN which have the exactly
                same functionalities as in most common coding languages. Also the if ... else commands work the very same logic as in other languages.
                And so does many other functionalities, and to name one for an example, a for-loop is made almost the same as in very basic programming 
                languages like Python. 
            </p>
   
            <h1>Libraries in Embedded Programming and NEOPIXEL in work</h1>
            <p>
                Libraries are collections of ready-made functions one can use after importing the library into use to help and simplify coding for 
                often some spesific purpose the library relates to. For example, Adafruit NEOPIXEL library provides an easier way to control NEOPIXEL LEDs.
                The library eases communication protocol handling as well as color mixing of the LEDs. In order for one to use NEOPIXEL library, one can 
                follow the instructions on <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-with-Arduino/">the documentation of the microcontroller used for this assignment</a> 
                for example.
                <br><br>
                An example of a program made using NEOPIXEL is visible below. The code file for this program can be downloaded via 
                <a href="/media/NEOPIXELS_demo/">this</a> link.
